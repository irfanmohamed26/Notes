Internal Commands:

Internal commands are built-in functionalities of the shell (e.g., Bash) itself.
These commands are executed directly by the shell without invoking an external program.
Since they are part of the shell, they execute more quickly and efficiently than external commands.
Examples of internal commands include cd, echo, pwd, history, alias, and exit.

External Commands:

External commands are standalone executable programs stored in the system's file system.
When you execute an external command, the shell searches for the command in directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
These commands are separate programs that run in their own processes.
External commands may offer more advanced functionality and capabilities compared to internal commands.
Examples of external commands include ls, grep, cat, cp, mv, rm, and mkdir.
